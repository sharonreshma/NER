# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Application

This repository contains a Python application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy, Pandas, and visualization tools.

## Overview

This project implements NER to identify and classify entities such as persons, organizations, and locations within text data. It leverages spaCy for natural language processing tasks, Pandas for data representation, and visualization tools for enhanced data understanding.

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies and categorizes entities in text data.
- **Visualization:** Utilizes spaCy's `displacy` for visualizing NER results, highlighting recognized entities.
- **Data Representation:** Pandas is used for managing and presenting NER outputs.

## Usage

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
- Enter text and click **Recognize Entities** to highlight named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, etc., using spaCy and displaCy.

2. **Data Representation:**
- Utilize Pandas for processing and visualizing NER outputs, enabling detailed analysis and insights.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a brief example of the NER visualization:
